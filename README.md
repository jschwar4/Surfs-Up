# Surfs-Up
1.	The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether year-round temperature and precipitation patterns in Oahu, Hawaii could support an ice cream shop that operates year-round. To this end, it does appear as though Oahu would be an ideal place to have an ice cream stand on the beach. The lowest recorded temperature over the entire dataset (from 2011 to 2017) is 54 degrees, while the highest recorded temperature is 85 degrees. The average temperature over the whole year is 71.67 degrees – ideal surfing weather.

The above summary statistics also tells us that the precipitation is heavily concentrated in a few days with a lot of rain. At least half of the days get virtually no rain whatsoever, and the high maximum precipitation and low mean suggest that there are a few very rainy days but a modest amount of rain overall.

a.	As you can see from the above summary statistics, the average temperatures for June and December are almost exactly the same.

b.	The other possible variation, amplitude, is also virtually the same between June and December. This is indicated by the relative differences between the lower and higher temperature ranges. The quartiles and standard deviation suggest that statistical amplitude is slightly higher in December, meaning that warmest and coolest temperatures are a little further apart than they are in June. This being said, the difference is fairly minor; there is only a .44 degree difference in standard deviation between the two months.

c.	The minimum temperatures in December are still warm, while the hottest temperatures in June are mild. In absolute terms, there are few days in either months that would be firmly outside of “beach weather.”

a.	The weather in Oahu is mild on average and across seasons, while the relative fluctuation in temperature is low. In layman’s terms, this means that the temperature is “nice” pretty much all the time. Furthermore, the low average and high maximum precipitation indicates that there is little rain most of the time, with the majority of it concentrated on a few days. 

b.	To further investigate this phenomena, I would recommend pulling a statistical summary of the precipitation in June and December. I would also make graphs to determine how many very high precipitation days are also the few low temperature days. Overlap here would further narrow “bad weather” days.
